                            Customer relationship management (CRM) is a term that refers to practices, 
                            strategies and technologies that companies use to manage and analyze customer 
                            interactions and data throughout the customer lifecycle, with the goal of 
                            improving business relationships with customers, assisting in customer retention 
                            and driving sales growth. CRM systems are designed to compile information on 
                            customers across different channels -- or points of contact between the customer 
                            and the company -- which could include the company&#39;s website, telephone, live 
                            chat, direct mail, marketing materials and social media. CRM systems can also 
                            give customer-facing staff detailed information on customers&#39; personal 
                            information, purchase history, buying preferences and concerns.</p>

                            Customer data analytics can reap significant financial rewards for your 
                            organization’s sales, marketing and customer service departments. With so much 
                            data to contend with, companies often struggle with making sense of information 
                            from customers, public records and external databases. Luckily, we evaluate the 
                            newest sales and marketing tools making the process easier for IT managers and 
                            sales executives.</p>
